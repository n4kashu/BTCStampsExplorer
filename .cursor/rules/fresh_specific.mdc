          notes: |
            Tailwind CSS setup is extensively customized via tailwind.config.ts.
            This includes many theme extensions (colors, fonts, spacing, etc.) 
            and custom utility classes added via an inline plugin.
            Refer to tailwind.config.ts for all specific theme values and utilities.
